**PowerShell** is a command line interface and scripting language available to Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. PowerShell was introduced to the Windows operating system in 2006 and has since become a popular tool for automating many administrative tasks.

Since PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language, it can run individual commands within the terminal as well as create and execute more complex scripts.
