**Penetration testing**, also referred to as pen testing, involves attempting to break into a system to better identify cybersecurity weaknesses so that the security posture can be improved. It is typically conducted by [ethical hackers](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/hacking) who have an offensive security lens.

## Penetration Testing vs. Assessments

A pen test is different from a vulnerability assessment in that pen testers are actively trying to exploit [vulnerabilities](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/vulnerability), simulating a [cyber attack](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/cyber-attack). The process may involve setting the goals and scope for the attack, conducting initial research, using a variety of methods to break into a system, seeing what access and damage is possible, and reporting on the work.

Ultimately, the goal is for clients to have a detailed understanding of where they are vulnerable and to help them to become as secure as possible.

## Pen Testers

Pen testing is conducted by ethical hackers who have permission to hack a clientâ€™s systems. Pen testers may be outsourced or in-house, sitting on the [red team](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/red-team) of a security organization. They use a diverse skill set including knowledge of network security, operating systems, software vulnerabilities, and IT administration to conduct their work.
