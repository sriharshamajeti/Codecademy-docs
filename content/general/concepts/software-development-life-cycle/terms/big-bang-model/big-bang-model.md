The **Big Bang model** is a [Software Development Life Cycle](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/software-development-life-cycle) (SDLC) model without specific processes.

The Big Bang model requires no or minimal planning. Instead, the development starts with acquiring the inputs, such as:

- Time.
- Effort.
- Resources.

This model focuses on software development so developers can jump straight to the implementation to create software as the outcome.

The diagram below shows an overview of the Big Bang model:

## Use-cases

The Big Bang model is best suited in the following cases:

- smaller or simple projects,
- small development teams,
- when requirements are not specified at the start of the project or can change during the development,
- experimental projects,
- projects for learning purposes.

## Advantages

The strength of the Big Bang model lies in its simplicity. This model can offer the following advantages:

- it requires no or minimal planning,
- it is easy to understand the process and manage the project,
- it can be time and cost-effective,
- it requires few resources,
- it provides flexibility for developers and also the project.

## Disadvantages

The Big Bang model, mainly due to the minimal planning included in it, has the following disadvantages:

- it is not suitable for complex, larger or ongoing projects,
- it comes with uncertainty, can have high risks and low reliability,
- unclear requirements at the beginning of the development can create higher costs or longer developmental times for the final product.
