**Artificial neural networks (ANN)** are a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way similar to the human brain.

## What Is An Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

- An ANN a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain.
- An ANN is one of the main tools used for machine learning. It is a brain-inspired system used to replicate the way that humans learn.

### The Process

- Neural networks are trained on specific data which is broken down into the input layer (where information is fed into), then to the hidden layer (where weight and bias are calculated from the input layer), and lastly the output layer (where information is output after algorithms are processed from the hidden and input layers). This is done via perceptrons (similar to human neurons but for machines to process, store, calculate, and move data forward).

## Relation To AI

### AI

- AI works on a collection of technologies that allow the computer to sense, learn, reason & act.
- AI works because of machine learning which is equipped with algorithms and vast amounts of datasets trained to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.

### ANN

- Neural networks are the core of deep learning algorithms. A neural network is trained on specific datasets from which it extracts the information and passes it through different layers searching for patterns.
- Once a neural network is trained on a dataset, it can start to encounter new scenarios and start making predictions based on that previous dataset.
