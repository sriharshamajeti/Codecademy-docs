**Generative Music** is the creation of long-playing high-fidelity music from text descriptions and additional sound input conditions.

GenAI can take the recorded hum of a melody and turn it into a song being played by guitar. It can change the style of any melody or song, for example, changing it to jazz, rock, or computer music.

Inputs can also be stories, images, or even music created from different media.

Some common tools include:

- Mubert Studio
- Jukebox from OpenAI
- MusicLM from Google
