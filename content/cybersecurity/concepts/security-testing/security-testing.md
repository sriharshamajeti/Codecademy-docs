**Security testing** is a critical aspect of software development that helps protect systems and applications from potential security threats.

- It examines security, discovers weaknesses, and confirms compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- With growing [cyber attacks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/cyber-attack) and data breaches, security testing is crucial to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.

There are three main methods for security testing:

- Black Box Testing
  - This approach to security testing evaluates a system or application without knowledge of its internal structure or implementation details. Black box testing focuses on functional requirements and the user interface, and can be used to identify security [vulnerabilities](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/vulnerability) that an attacker would exploit.
- White Box Testing
  - This approach to security testing evaluates a system or application with knowledge of its internal structure and implementation details. White box testing focuses on code-level security, including input validation, error handling, and access controls.
- Gray Box Testing
  - This approach to security testing combines elements of both black box and white box testing. Gray box testing provides some knowledge of the internal structure of a system or application, but not a complete understanding. This type of testing is useful for identifying security vulnerabilities that would be missed by black box testing but may not be as comprehensive as white box testing.

### Additional Domains and Elements of Security Testing

- Vulnerability assessment: This is the process of identifying, classifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in a system or application. Vulnerability assessments can be performed manually or with automated tools.
- [Penetration Testing](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/penetration-testing): This type of testing simulates an attack on a system or application to identify security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Penetration testing is usually performed by [ethical hackers](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/hacking), who use the same tools and techniques as malicious hackers to identify potential security issues.
- Network Security Testing: This type of testing focuses on the security of a network infrastructure, including firewalls, routers, and switches. Network security testing can identify vulnerabilities in network configurations and help prevent unauthorized access, data theft, and other security threats.
- Application Security Testing: This type of testing focuses on the security of individual applications, including web applications, mobile apps, and desktop applications. Application security testing can identify vulnerabilities in the code, architecture, and deployment of an application.
- Database Security Testing: This type of testing focuses on the security of databases and the sensitive data they contain. Database security testing can identify vulnerabilities in database configurations, access controls, data encryption, and help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Infrastructure Security Testing: This type of testing focuses on the security of an organization's infrastructure, including servers, storage devices, and other components that make up the backbone of an organization's IT environment. Infrastructure security testing can identify vulnerabilities in the configuration and deployment of infrastructure components.
- Threat modeling: This is a process of identifying potential security threats to a system or application and determining the likelihood and impact of each threat. Threat modeling helps prioritize security testing efforts and identify areas that need improvement.
- Compliance Testing: This type of testing verifies that a system or application complies with industry regulations and standards, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or ISO 27001. Compliance testing helps ensure that an organization's security practices meet the requirements of regulatory bodies and help prevent legal and financial consequences.
- Remediation: After security weaknesses are identified during testing, remediation involves fixing the vulnerabilities and implementing security controls to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Maintenance: Security testing should be an ongoing process to ensure the continued security of a system or application. Regular security testing, vulnerability assessments, and remediation are essential to maintaining the security of a system or application over time.
